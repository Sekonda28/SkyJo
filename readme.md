## Plan and objectvies
My objective is to recreate the card game [_SkyJo_}(https://www.magilano.com/produkt/skyjo/?lang=en&v=79cba1185463) in the web browser to allow 2 people to play against each other.  Longer term, the plan will be to expand this to more players and also develop AI players as well.  SkyJo is a numbers based game, so there will be a number of rules and functions to develop to allow players to choose cards and keep track of scores. This will be my first fully independent piece of development so I will periodically update this ReadMe as this develops.
